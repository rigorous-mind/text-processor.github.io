A tiny project to help people who despise adding HTML markup to their text files themselves do it automaticall. The projects currently consists of a single textarea element and just a handful of options to let the users decide how they would like to markup their text. Although I would love to expand it, however, I cannot offer any guarantees. 

Would love to add the options to allow users to markup text with headings and subheadings markedup properly, as well.
